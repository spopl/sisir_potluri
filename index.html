            <div class="text basic1">→ Finish EECS 203 &amp; 280 in your first year, so you can take EECS 281 in the following spring/fall (and be prepared for internship interviews).<br><br>→ If you&#x27;re unsure about programming, then take EECS 280 ASAP to figure out if coding interests you (but know that industrial SWE is vastly different).<br>‍<br>→ Taking EECS 281 with EECS 376 can be synergistic — the practical concepts in 281 have their theoretical analyses in 376, which is super helpful for something like dynamic programming.<br>‍<br>→ Take EECS 485 ASAP for a wide introduction to industrial web systems and various domains like multithreading, networks, and security.<br><br>→ If you plan on working as a software engineer, then EECS 481 will clarify and sophisticate your understanding of what it&#x27;s like to work as an SWE in a large company.<br><br>→ At various points in the curriculum, it may seem like others around you &quot;know it all&quot; and are expert programmers — this feeling is normal, and it doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re a bad engineer. Being able to learn &amp; apply new skills is way more valuable than having pre-existing knowledge of specific tools or topics.<br><br>→ Start projects early. Since you won&#x27;t, my other suggestion is to READ THE ENTIRE SPEC when starting. If you&#x27;ve hit a roadblock while coding, go walk around or watch some YouTube. When you return, you&#x27;ll probably realize something that was obvious.<br><br>→ If you&#x27;re stressed about something right now, calm down. In a month or two, you won&#x27;t care about whatever it is that&#x27;s causing you to panic.<br>‍</div>
          </div>
          <div data-w-tab="Tab 2" class="tab-pane-tab-2 w-tab-pane">
            <div class="text basic1">→ Aim for 450+ words on a resume, but keep it to 1 page for early-career engineering roles.<br><br>→ On resumes, instead of saying &quot;I built __ using __&quot;, explain the impact that your work had. It&#x27;s far more important to explain the utility of your application or project rather than the technical details of it. To support this, make sure to get some metrics and data points from each internship or side endeavor.<br>‍<br>→ Do projects and more projects until you get some research and/or internships. GitHub links, YouTube demos, and even PDF specs or documentation can come in handy to showcase what you&#x27;ve done.<br>‍<br>→ Instead of cramming practice problems the week of an interview, do these consistently. Since you probably won&#x27;t, I&#x27;d suggest using Leetcode premium from August to October to rank problem frequency and filter problems by company during cram sessions.<br><br>→ There have been cases where students with no experience landed Facebook or Apple offers as well as times where students who had multiple FAANG internships got zero offers. The long-term reality is somewhere in between.<br><br>→ Talk A LOT during the interview. When solving technical problems, literally keep talking. But don&#x27;t get redundant — you should be discussing tradeoffs (Big-O here) and reasons for code choices, how you&#x27;ll use a function later, and edge cases.<br><br>→ When describing an experience, you should go a little beyond just STAR (situation-task-action-result). Use specificity to highlight your engineering skills via examples and details. Instead of &quot;I discussed tradeoffs with my mentor and made a decision&quot; say &quot;I explained tradeoffs based on performance metrics to my mentor when we finalized my design document&quot;.<br><br>→ No need to worry throughout the process. There are many paths to get to your end goal, and that&#x27;s one of the happy things about this career path.<br></div>
          </div>
          <div data-w-tab="Tab 3" class="tab-pane-tab-3 w-tab-pane">
            <div class="text basic1">→ It&#x27;s vital to have a good notion of what you&#x27;ve accomplished and the various ways your prior experiences curated your current skillset. Since it&#x27;s easy to forget small details over time, keep a central file/note that has all your work and projects. For each, add what you did, the skills involved, and key learnings.<br><br>→ Build a simple but elegant personal website using Webflow or another no-code tool and host it using GitHub pages — having an online presence where you present basic information will let you review your goals and changing skillset over time.<br>‍<br>→ If there is a job position or career track that interests you, use LinkedIn to connect with some professionals who are in that position (this is easier if they&#x27;re alumni). Set up brief chats to learn how they got to where they are, advice and tradeoffs, and the perks of their role.<br>‍<br>→ College is about more than learning the topics in your major/minor. Use this time to educate yourself on critical reasoning, the construction of social norms &amp; culture, and fallacies of the human mind. Classes in philosophy, anthropology, and psychology can help you become a more balanced individual.<br><br>→ Here&#x27;s my work stack for college (it may/may not suit you): Goodnotes on iPad &amp; MacBook for handwritten worksheets and annotated lecture slides, Microsoft Word on MacBook for typed reports and exam reviews, iCloud for file storage, and Google Calendar synced to MacBook &amp; iPhone Calendar for task scheduling.<br><br>→ A single place to write every random idea that comes up. One day, one of these may lead to brilliance.</div>
          </div>
          <div data-w-tab="Tab 4" class="tab-pane-tab-4 w-tab-pane">
            <div class="text basic1">→ The Business Minor program is a phenomenal way to learn some of the fundamentals that are covered in the Ross BBA program, with topics such as finance, accounting, and marketing.<br><br>→ Instead of getting two degrees - like one BBA and one BSE in CS - decide which area you want a job in and major in that. Then, minor in the other. In general, there aren&#x27;t positions that specifically seek deep knowledge in both topics, so the additional electives in one area could add 1-2 semesters more without a lot of benefit to your career.<br>‍<br>→ Taking an investment banking class (even if you don&#x27;t want a job in IB or PE) can give you so much knowledge about capital structuring, risk and return, and mergers/buyouts. Having this industry-scale knowledge of finance is useful and fun.<br>‍<br>→ If you&#x27;d like to start a business, then know that college is one of the prime ways to connect with people across various disciplines and find young, driven students who share your passion. At UMich, ES 395 is a course that&#x27;s built around starting a new venture.<br><br>→ You might be surrounded by many stories of success and billion-dollar-deals. Seek out stories about failures too.<br><br>→ What you learn within the walls of an academic institution will only take you so far. If you seek to become a successful businessperson, then use the business program to CLARIFY your knowledge, but work in the real world to prepare for success.<br></div>
          </div>
          <div data-w-tab="Tab 5" class="tab-pane-tab-5 w-tab-pane">
            <div class="text basic1">→ One of the most challenging aspects of writing is to be unique, authentic, and original, while still creating something that a lot of people will connect with. How can this be done? Here&#x27;s an idea: the more specific you are, as you weave the many intricacies of &quot;your life&quot; into the narrative, the more intriguing your writing will feel. An intrigued reader will make it to the end without feeling bored. And, when you write something that is so personal and real, there&#x27;ll be a human aspect to the piece - a primal theme that is conveyed through your story. This element is what will make people connect to your story. Despite it being original and incredibly specific to you, it will carry a message that has meaning for everyone.<br>‍<br>→ What makes you stressed almost every day? What internal questions or dilemmas do you try to escape? What&#x27;s a memory that seeps into your mind at least once a day? Write about these. Write to relieve yourself of the things that are ambiguous and sticky.<br>‍<br>→ Write to freeze this time of your life. The ideas that keep reappearing, the faces that you see every day, and the music that gets you through long walks. This phase of your life has many facets, and there&#x27;s fun in identifying those and getting them down somewhere. One day in the future, when you re-read these ancient stories, you&#x27;ll get to step back into the past for a few moments.<br><br>→ Being able to write well is a skill that&#x27;s easy to take for granted. There&#x27;s a wide gap between typing words into a document and writing something that is insightful. Don&#x27;t limit yourself to &quot;what&quot; happened. Go deeper into the &quot;why.&quot; Why did it happen? Why does it matter that it happened? Write with personality - you&#x27;re a person, not ChatGPT.<br><br>→ You may meet people who believe writing is a dumb skill. If you start writing more, you&#x27;ll know why they&#x27;re wrong.<br><br>→ Writing will change the way you think, forcing you to consider simple ideas in wider scope. The need for specificity will make you apply a societal lens, a philosophical lens, and even a scientific lens to every insight that you discover. That moment where you stop and think &quot;how can I write this most accurately&quot; is what will lead to new connections and more clarified understanding.<br></div>
